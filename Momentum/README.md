# Preset Patches

# Instructions

The source code **requires** at least Teensyduino 1.54 from [PJRC](https://pjrc.com) to compile. You also need CircularBuffer from Agileware and Adafruit_GFX, which are available in the Arduino Library Manager. **NOTE** if using Teensyduino 1.55, you'll need to [remove a line from TeensyThreads.cpp](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/68192-Teensyduino-1-55-Released)
